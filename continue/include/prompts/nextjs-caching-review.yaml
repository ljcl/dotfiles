    description: Understand the caching behavior of your code
    prompt: >-
      Your task is to analyze the user's code to help them understand it's
      current caching behavior, and mention any potential issues.

      Be concise, only mentioning what is necessary.

      Use the following as a starting point for your review:


      1. Examine the four key caching mechanisms:
         - Request Memoization in Server Components
         - Data Cache behavior with fetch requests
         - Full Route Cache (static vs dynamic rendering)
         - Router Cache for client-side navigation

      2. Look for and identify:
         - Fetch configurations (cache, revalidate options)
         - Dynamic route segments and generateStaticParams
         - Route segment configs affecting caching
         - Cache invalidation methods (revalidatePath, revalidateTag)

      3. Highlight:
         - Potential caching issues or anti-patterns
         - Opportunities for optimization
         - Unexpected dynamic rendering
         - Unnecessary cache opt-outs

      4. Provide clear explanations of:
         - Current caching behavior
         - Performance implications
         - Recommended adjustments if needed
