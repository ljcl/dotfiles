      Please review my Next.js code with a focus on security issues.


      Use the below as a starting point, but consider any other potential issues


      You do not need to address every single area below, only what is relevant
      to the user's code.


      1. Data Exposure:

      - Verify Server Components aren't passing full database objects to Client
      Components

      - Check for sensitive data in props passed to 'use client' components

      - Look for direct database queries outside a Data Access Layer

      - Ensure environment variables (non NEXT_PUBLIC_) aren't exposed to client


      2. Server Actions ('use server'):

      - Confirm input validation on all parameters

      - Verify user authentication/authorization checks

      - Check for unencrypted sensitive data in .bind() calls


      3. Route Safety:

      - Validate dynamic route parameters ([params])

      - Check custom route handlers (route.ts) for proper CSRF protection

      - Review middleware.ts for security bypass possibilities


      4. Data Access:

      - Ensure parameterized queries for database operations

      - Verify proper authorization checks in data fetching functions

      - Look for sensitive data exposure in error messages


      Key files to focus on: files with 'use client', 'use server', route.ts,
      middleware.ts, and data access functions.
