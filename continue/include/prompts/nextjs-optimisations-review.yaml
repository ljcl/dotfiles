    description: Check for any potential optimizations that are missing in your code
    prompt: >-
      Please review my Next.js code with a focus on optimization areas.


      Use the below as a starting point, but consider any other potential areas
      for improvement.


      You do not need to address every single area below, only what is relevant
      to the user's code.


      1. Images: Check for proper usage of next/image, responsive sizing,
      priority loading for LCP, and correct image formats.


      2. Font Loading: Verify next/font implementation, font subsetting, and
      proper loading strategies.


      3. Component Loading: Identify opportunities for lazy loading using
      next/dynamic, especially for client components and heavy libraries.


      4. Metadata: Ensure proper metadata implementation for SEO using either
      config-based or file-based approaches.


      5. Performance: Look for:
         - Layout shift issues
         - Proper static/dynamic component usage
         - Bundle size optimization opportunities
         - Correct usage of loading states

      Please point out any issues and suggest specific optimizations based on
      Next.js best practices.
